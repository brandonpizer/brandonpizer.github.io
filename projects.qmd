## Current Project

As of right now I am working to refine this website using Rstudio and GitHub. 

This is my first ever project working with Quarto so the learning curve has been quite steep. However, I am learning many useful skills such as being able differentiate between file types, edit website attributes in .qmd documents, understanding file paths, and many more skills!
